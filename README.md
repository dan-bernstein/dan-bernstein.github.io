# Dan Bernstein's Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted at [dan-bernstein.github.io](https://dan-bernstein.github.io). This site showcases my technical and creative projects, highlighting my skills in engineering, design, and research. Built with modern web technologies, it features a clean, responsive design and dynamic content rendering.

## Features

- **System Theme Support**: Automatically adapts to light or dark mode based on the userâ€™s system preferences (`prefers-color-scheme`).
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Markdown files in `posts/` and `projects/` are fetched and rendered as cards

## Code Structure

The website is built as a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, with the following key components:

- **`index.html`**: The main entry point, containing the HTML structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic rendering and interactions.
- **`assets/`**: Stores static assets like images
- **`posts/`**: Markdown files for creative projects, rendered in the "Creative Projects" section.
- **`projects/`**: Markdown files for technical work, displayed in the "Technical Work" section 
- **`files.json`**: A JSON file listing Markdown files, generated by a GitHub Actions workflow for dynamic content loading.
- **`.github/workflows/generate-files.yml`**: Automates the creation of `files.json` when `posts/*.md` or `projects/*.md` files change, using Node.js.
