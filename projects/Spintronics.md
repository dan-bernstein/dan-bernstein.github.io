* Performed AFM & SEM imaging on MTJs to characterize junctions and inform effectiveness of nanofabrication techniques
* Compared junction characteristics to transport properties to evaluate MTJ energy effeciency as a means of data storage
* Presented research at 2023 APS March Meeting and to physics department faculty
